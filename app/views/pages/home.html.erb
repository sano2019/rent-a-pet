    <h2>Our goal</h2>
    <p>We here at Rent a Pet hate to see animals being lonely. We understand that you are in a situation from time to time where you can't take your pet. Instead of having the high costs of a pound, why not let someone foster it for the time you are gone?
    </p>
    <h2>Our values</h2>
    <p>We believe animals deserve the best care they can get. By fostering an animal, you are preventing them from being sent to a pound where they are in a small enclosure for the duration of their stay. Why not have a look at the following animals and rent yourself a companion for a few days while helping someone out?
